Add a consumer to a group
-------------------------

Endpoint:

	https://auth.iudx.org.in/auth/v1/group/add

Description:

	This API is used to add a consumer to a group.

	Groups are useful in setting access control polcies where access to
	resources is given to a group of consumers.

	This is done using the "consumer-in-group(group-name)" function in
	the aperture policy when using the "/acl/set" API.

Called by:

	A "data provider" with a valid class-3 or above certificate.

Methods:

	POST

Headers:

	content-type : "application/json"

Body in JSON format:

	{
		"group"	: <a valid group name created by the user>			// required
		"consumer"	: <the consumer's email-id, which is to be added to the group>	// required
		"valid-till"	: <how long (in hours) the consumer will be in the group>	// required
	}

	Note: If the "group" doesn't exist, it will be created automatically.

Using pyIUDX SDK:

	from pyIUDX.auth import auth

	iudx_auth = auth.Auth("certificate.pem","private-key.pem")

	# add user@domain.com to confidential group for 1 hour
	iudx_auth.add_consumer_to_group("user@domain.com","confidential",1)

CURL example:

	Request:

		curl -XPOST https://auth.iudx.org.in/auth/v1/group/add

			--cert certificate.pem --key private-key.pem

			-H 'content-type: application/json'

			-d '{"group" : "confidential","consumer" : "user@domain.com", "valid-till" : 3600}'

	Response:

		200 OK
		content-type : "application/json"

		{
			"success" : true
		}
